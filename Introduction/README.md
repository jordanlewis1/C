See the instructions in each of the .c programs for what to do with each of
them.  Some of the instructions are questions.  Add your answer to each
question immediately after the question.

Carefully use a .gitignore file to avoid including any binary files in your
repository.  io.c creates a file name file.  This output file should also
not be included in your repository.
