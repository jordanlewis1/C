## Introduction

See the instructions in each of the `.c` programs for what to do with each of
them.  Some of the instructions are questions.  Add your answer to each
question immediately after the question.

Carefully use a `.gitignore` file to avoid including any binary files in your
repository.  `io.c` creates an output file named `file`.  This output file
should also be excluded from your repository.
