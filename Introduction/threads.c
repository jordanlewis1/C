/*

    This program creates two threads.  Each thread increments a shared
    counter by 1 for the number of times indicated by the passed in command
    line argument.

    To compile:

        gcc -g -Wall -o threads threads.c -pthread

    1) What is the purpose of the -pthread argument here?  Why is it
       necessary? 
       -pthreads purpose is to connect the binary program with a library that allows pthread_create to be used.

    2) What code does each thread run?
    

    3) How many total threads will be running immediately after the second
       pthread_create call has completed?
       three

    4) Explain what pthread_join does.
    This waits for the thread to be terminated.  If so it returns.

    5) If the program is run thusly:

           ./threads 42

       What should the output be?  Is the correct output produced?
       The output should be 82 because you are hard coding the threads.

    6) Explain what happens, and why it happens, when the program is run
       thusly:

           ./threads 100000
           
           The thread is taking too long and the Cpu gives it to the other thread

    7) Modify the program so that it determines how many threads to create
       and how many loops each thread runs from command line arguments.
       For example

           ./threads 100000 100000

       creates two threads and each thread loops 100000 times.  On the other
       hand

           ./threads 42 420 4200

       creates three threads.  The first thread loops 42 times, the second
       420 times, and the third 4200 times.

       To accomplish this, read the man page for pthread_create(3).  The loop
       count should be passed to start_routine via arg.  Doing so will require
       type casts from long to void * and back.

       You may assume that no more than 10 loop counts are passed on the
       command line.  If more than 10 loop counts are passed, print an error
       message to stderr and exit with a status of 1.
