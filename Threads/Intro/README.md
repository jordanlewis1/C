A simple set of programs that use threads:
- `t0.c`
- `t1.c`

Each one depends on header files found in `../../Includes`

The Makefile is simplistic but will do.  To use it run this from the shell:
```
make
```
To remove your binaries run
```
make clean
```
To make just one program run
```
make t0
```
